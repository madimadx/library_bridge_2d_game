Project description:

I would like to modify player movement so it's not smooth but at intervals, like hopping.
I will limit movement to just in the bridge. For levels, I'd like to imitate frogger in that each
level has more obstacles and gets quicker. The end will be some certain number of levels, perhaps 10.

The player will have 3 lives. They respawn where they die until they run out of lives and then have to start from the beginning.

I will add more sprites and variety in them and they will be placed along the bridge.

Score is based on how far they go in the game.
