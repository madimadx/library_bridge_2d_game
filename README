Project description: Added parallax and 2 way multi-sprites to vertical
  scrolling game.

What sprite did I repeat at least 7 times? My 2-way running man multisprite.

What sprite (not Sprite or MultiSprite) did I design? The running man, single
  and multi.

The easiest part of this project: Making the graphics. I'll put more work
  into them later.

Problems that I had in completing this project: Ooooeeeee I think I have some
  memory leaks. I also had some trouble with getting all the iterators down.
